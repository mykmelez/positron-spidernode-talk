		<!--
		Positron is an Electron-compatible desktop application framework
		that uses Gecko instead of Chromium.  It's a Mozilla app, but it lives
		on GitHub in a fork of gecko-dev, with minimal changes to upstream code.

		<h2 class="shout">Tofino</h2>
		<!--
		So why Positron?  Well, our initial goal is to make it possible
		to run Tofino on Gecko.

		<h2>Electron</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>shallow learning curve</li>
			<li>robust ecosystem (Node)</li>
			<li>momentum (Tofino, Brave, Min, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<!--
		But also, Electron has a shallow and gentle learning curve,
		especially for web developers.  It also has a robust ecosystem
		of Node packages.  And it has momentum in the marketplace
		for desktop application frameworks.

		Desktop browser experiments are proliferating, and they're mostly
		being built on Electron, including not only Tofino but also Brave,
		a browser called Min, and other such projects.

		Electron is powering the next generation of desktop browsers,
		so it's worth embracing.

			<li>"main" script</li>
			<li>BrowserWindow</li>
			<li>IPC</li>
			<li>&lt;webview&gt;</li>
			<li>some Node modules</li>
		</ul>
		<!--
		We started working on Positron in April, and it currently runs
		a small subset of Electron apps.  It has partial support for running
		the "main" script of an Electron app, opening BrowserWindows,
		doing IPC between BrowserWindows and the main script,
		and loading unprivileged pages in <webview> elements.

		It supports some Node modules with a Node-like module loader,
		although it doesn't yet have Node itself.

		and then determine the additional use cases for the project.

    <!--
    SpiderNode attempts to be a drop-in replacement for Node based on SpiderMonkey.
    The implementation works by implementing the V8 API on top of the JSAPI,
    with the goal of being source compatible with code using the V8 embedding API.
    So far we have upstreamed a few patches to SpiderMonkey with a few additional
    patches pending, and have one modification to the Node source code to stop
    using |for (const x of iterable)|.

              </ul>
            </li>
		</ul>
	</section>
    <!--
    While working on SpiderNode, we came across different parts of the API where
    the mapping from V8 to SpiderMonkey concepts varied from very straightforward
    to extremely ugly.

    For example, V8 encodes small integers as int32 and uses a fat 64-bit value
    representation for other data, but this fact is hidden at the API boundaries,
    so we made SpiderShim's V8::Value be 64-bit always and binary compatible with
    JS::Value.

    Mapping of the GC rooting API was difficult since the underlying mechanism in
    V8 and SpiderMonkey are vastly different.  We managed to simulate the V8
    behavior on top of SpiderMonkey by having a giant Rooted linked list in order
    to be able to pass pointers to the list items behind v8::Local, but this is
    probably going to turn out to be slow if not because of anything else because
    we'd have many more GC roots than strictly necessary.

    Then there are things for which there was no underlying SpiderMonkey concept.
    For example, V8's Object/FunctionTemplate, where we needed to write a lot of
    glue code that hopefully simulates V8's observed behavior.

      <h2>Current Status</h2>
		<ul>
          <li>As of last week, we can run SpiderNode!</li>
          <li>Still a few functions left to implement</li>
          <li>Try running more V8 tests</li>
          <li>Figure out the next steps</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
    <!--
    Since we started with an existing code base, we spent around 2 months working
    on the individual bits and pieces used by Node, without being able to test any
    of the actual work because we couldn't link Node due to the missing symbols.
    We started to write gtests for things we were implementing, and after a while
    we started porting the V8 API tests which examined stuff that we support.

    As of early last week, we managed to link and run SpiderNode by stubbing out
    a few remaining functions which we're working on finishing.  Currently if you
    have a valid Node application, it should work, but things are brittle, and if
    your program throws an exception or encounters an error, you're mostly on your
    own.
